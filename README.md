TODO
- make a graph, per quake, of the falloff of "quakeAlignWithPreviousGeodesicAngleThreshold" - number of geodesics that align with this quake vs the threshold angle size.
	... because I've got it as tight as 0.1 degrees and every single quake still aligns with geodesics ... i.e. for every quake, there's 2 or more other quakes on Earth already forming a straight line with it.
- when creating geodesics, filter out identical pairs to prevent those huge alpha stacking over high-quantity (low-magnitude) areas
	- make this optional
- click to select point and geodesic
